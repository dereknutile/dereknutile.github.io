    <p>I'm married to a beautiful goddess and father to four kick-ass boys.</p>

    <p>I seek balance; I try to enjoy my world &mdash; but not too much.  I try to be exceptional at work, but not work endlessly.  I try to lead and inspire my kids because I find inspiration from them.  I try to make my wife, Kiana, know how deeply I am connected with her every day.  I try to eat well, be fit, and laugh.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI" target="_blank">I wear sunscreen</a> because Baz Luhrmann knew what he was talking about.</p>

    <p>I truly value effort and hard work.  I can smell lazy and insincerity from 26.2 miles away, and I have no time for it.</p>

    <p><a href="http://github.com/dereknutile/" target="_blank">I'm a professional developer</a>.  I love functional, safe, efficient code.  I enjoy learning and being a part of new technology and the Internet.  I am a professional troubleshooting problem solver.  I've been working with technology since the early 1990's.</p>
