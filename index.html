        <p>Hi, I'm Derek.</p>
        <p>I've been around information systems since the early 1990's and consider myself a pretty well rounded technologist with a strength for efficiency and automation and a passion for making web applications.</p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>During the day, I work for <a href="http://www.co.washington.or.us/" target="_blank">Washington County Oregon</a> as a Web System Adminstrator.</p>
    <p>My core functions at Washington County are to keep the many web properties up and running and plan for the future while being mindful of our customers &mdash; the citizens of Washington County.</p>

    <h3>In My Free Time</h3>
    <p>I'm married to a beautiful goddess and father to four kick-ass boys.</p>
    <p>When I'm not running, laughing, or playing, I develop freelance projects for small businesses, the open source community, and myself.</p>
    <p>Finally, I run a small web agency called <a href="http://pixelnewt.com/" target="_blank">PixelNewt</a>.  This offers me an opportunity to stay engaged with the development community, interact with clients, and run a small business.</p>

    <p>I started my career in technology working with point-of-sale hardware and software and since then I've supported thousands of users at a large law firm, created internal helpdesk software and portals for clients, and worked independently and with agencies to create beautiful websites and applications.</p>
