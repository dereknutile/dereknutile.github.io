Why is it so hard for some people to say **no**?  Especially when no is what they want to say?

I feel like I've spent the better part of 2014 surrounded by people who are unable to say no.  As a parent, you are often forced to be clear as possible, or as vague as possible depending on the situation.  I'm inclined to believe that is also true for business.
