<p>A full stack developer, to me, is a well rounded programmer.  There are many articles that attempt to define what programming for the full stack means, but I think it's best summarized as a person who is comfortable, if not exceptional, at front end development, back end development, as well as devops.</p>

<p>That's me!  I started this career as a tinkerer and technology enthusiast.  I built systems using Windows and Linux in the 90's, and then started building networks to support thousands of nodes.  The computers on those networks needed automated management, so I started writing scripts in Perl, Python, and C++ to distribute packages across wide area networks.  My peers who supported the people on the computers on those networks needed a way to log and report problems and solutions, so I wrote a web based helpdesk application (my first web appication) using PHP and MySQL.  The rest, as they say, is history and documented on my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume">resume</a>.</p>
